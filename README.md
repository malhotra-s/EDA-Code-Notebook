# Analysis of Fatal Police Shootings
This project analyzes the dataset on fatal police shootings from 2015 to 2022. 

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is is to unveil patterns, trends, and potential disparities within these incidents through advanced data analysis techniques. 
By leveraging the power of data, we aim to contribute valuable insights that can inform discussions on law enforcement practices, social justice, and public safety.

## Project Description
The [sourced dataset](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings/blob/master/v1/fatal-police-shootings-data.csv) used for the project is compiled by The Washington Post. 
Data visualization and predictive modeling techniques are used to analyze fatal police shootings incidents data from 2015 to 2022 in the United States. 
Regarding the question "How does the perceived level of threat impact the occurrence of police shootings throughout the United States?", 
line charts and histograms were employed to identify patterns and temporal trends. 
Predictive Modeling techniques such as Chi-squared test and Logistic Regression Modelling were used to investigate potential relationships between variables including *age, gender, race, and weapon type*.
